We introduce **CVQA: a novel, multilingual, culturally nuanced VQA benchmark that includes a diverse set of languages, many of them underrepresented and understudied** in NLP. 

 - **A culturally diverse multilingual VQA**: Our data consists of 10k questions across 30 countries, covering 31 languages. We also sub-categorize CVQA based on Country-Language pairs, resulting in 39 distinct pairs. CVQA is written in both English and local languages, enabling us to benchmark multilingual Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and English-only MLLMs.
- **Baseline Evaluation**: we provide an initial set of evaluations on this benchmark, to serve as a baseline for future research on vision-language models that are culturally diverse.
