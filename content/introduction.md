# CVQA

We introduce **CVQA: a novel, large-scale, multilingual, culturally nuanced VQA benchmark that includes a diverse set of languages, including many that are underrepresented and understudied**. Our data consists of 9k questions across 28 countries, covering 26 languages. We also sub-categorize CVQA based on Country-Language pairs, resulting in 33 distinct pairs. CVQA is written in both English and local languages, enabling us to benchmark multilingual MLLMs and English-only MLLMs.

Our contributions can be summarised as follows:

- **A culturally diverse multilingual VQA**:  consisting of over 9,000 questions from across 28 countries and 26 languages.
- **Baseline Evaluation**: we provide an initial set of evaluations on this benchmark, to serve as a baseline for future research on vision-language models that are culturally diverse.
