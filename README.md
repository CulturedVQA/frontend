# CVQA-Website

Welcome to our repository. This website is used to build our site, https://cvqa-benchmark.org

## How do you develop it?

Initially, we follow this [repository](https://github.com/eliahuhorwitz/Academic-project-page-template) to build our website. However it is not modular enough. As a result, we implement this template in [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/)

## Can we use your code?

Yes, all of the code are under CC-SA 4.0 License. 

The images and logo are under [CC-BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

## How to run it?

1. First, install Hugo to your computer. See this [Link](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for further information.
2. Build using `hugo` command or use `hugo server` to test your site.
3. Adjust the content accordingly.

## How to modify the content

See `content/_index.md` to see how the content got structured. Adjust the file (.md) and the content as you desire.

To update the site template, you can visit `themes/`. Update `css` and `js` if you want to update the website's style.


## What libraries do you use?

We use these:

1. Hugo
2. Bulma
3. Font awesome
